## Project Structure


- **public/images/**: Contains images used in the project.
- **public/styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the project.
- **public/script.js**: Contains the  compiled JavaScript code for fetching and displaying advice.
- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the web app.
- **src/app.ts**: Contains the main typescript file for the project

## UPDATE!!!!
- integration of typescript to add robust type checking to prevent bugs and potential edge cases
The transition to TypeScript was made to introduce static type checking, which helps in catching errors during development rather than at runtime.
This change enhances code reliability and makes the application more maintainable and scalable.
